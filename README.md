_What if Francisco Goya had played Minecraft?_
![Painting Montage](montage.png)

This is a simple mod that adds additional paintings, supposedly in the style of [Francisco Goya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Goya, "Francisco Goya"). These artworks were generated using [Craiyon](https://www.craiyon.com "Craiyon") by supplying various combinations of the words "Minecraft", "Oil Painting" and "Francisco Goya", as well as some subject-matter keywords. They were then automatically processed and cropped to better fit the in-game block resolution using [ImageMagick.](https://imagemagick.org "ImageMagick Site")

If you've been in the mood for some mildly-disquieting oil paintings for your Minecraft mansion, then this is the mod for you!

## Features
